# muon_gfx

Muon bindings for SDL and OpenGL for Windows and Linux. (Note to macOS users: I'm unable to test on macOS myself, but with a few tweaks things should work on macOS too).

With this repo you can make cross-platform SDL and OpenGL programs in Muon! See [spinning_cube](spinning_cube) for an example.

Also see the [READMEs](sdl_bindings/README.md) [in various](opengl_bindings/README.md) [subdirectories](opengl_generator/README.md) for more info.
